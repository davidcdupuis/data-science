# Regression Algorithms

Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or predictors). It's used for prediction and forecasting.

Regression algorithms are supervised.

The most popular are:

* Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR)
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Stepwise Regression
* Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
* Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS)
