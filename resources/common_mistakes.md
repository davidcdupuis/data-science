# [13 Common Mistakes and How to Avoid them](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/07/13-common-mistakes-aspiring-fresher-data-scientists-make-how-to-avoid-them/)


### 1. Learning Theoretical Concepts without Applying Them

  As soon as you learn a concept, head over to Google and find a dataset or problem where you can use it.
  You will have to accept that you cannot learn everything in one go. Fill in the gaps as you practice and you will learn a whole lot more!

### 2. Heading Straight for Machine Learning Techniques without Learning the Prerequisites

  Core Machine Learning requires:
  * Linear Algebra -> http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/
  * Calculus
  * Statistics
  * Probability -> https://www.probabilitycourse.com/

### 3. Relying Solely on Certifications and Degrees

  Practice, practice, practice!

### 4. Assuming that what you see in ML Competitions is what Real-Life Jobs are Like

### 5. Focusing on Model Accuracy over Applicability and Interpretability in the Domain

  Make data science projects more practical than theoretical.

### 6. Using too many Data Science Terms in your Resume

### 7. Giving Tools and Libraries Precedence over the Business Problem

  * Understand the industry
  * Practice on datasets from that industry

### 10. Trying to Learn Multiple Tools at Once

  Pick one tool and stick to it until you have mastery over it.
  Learn data science through the tool

### 11. Not Studying in a Consistent Manner

  Set goals for yourself. Map out a time table and stick it on your wall. Plan how and what you want to study and set deadlines for yourself.

### 12. Shying Away from Discussions and Competitions

  Start doing it!

### 13. Not working on Communication Skills

  Practice explaining data science terms to a non-technical person.
