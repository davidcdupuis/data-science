# Python Data Science Libraries

List of practical Python Data Science libraries and associated functions

## Numpy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

* a powerful N-dimensional array object
* sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
* tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
* useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

## Pandas

Pandas is the primary tool used to dissect dataframes in Python. It's good to know how to manipulated dataframes with it. It's also important to know how to find specific type of data in dataframes with pandas.

## Scikit-learn

## Bokeh

## Matplotlib

## Seaborn
