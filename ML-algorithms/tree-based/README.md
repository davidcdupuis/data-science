# Tree Based Algorithms

The most popular are:

* Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
* Iterative Dichotomiser3 (ID3)
* C4.5
* C5.0
* Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)
* Decision Stump
* Conditional Decision Trees
* MS

**Decision Tree**

A supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification problems. But it does work for continuous predictions. In this algorithm, we split the population into two or more homogeneous sets. This is done based on most significant attributes/independent variables to make as distinct groups as possible. (see [link](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/04/complete-tutorial-tree-based-modeling-scratch-in-python/))

Population splits can be done using various techniques: Gini, Information Gain, Chi-square, Entropy.
